Changelog
=========

v1.6 (November 6th, 2017)
-------------------------

This is a release with various small changes and mainly some speed
improvements to the Balance Sheet and the net worth calculation. Also, if 'At
Value' is selected, the current unrealized gain is shown in parentheses in the
Balance Sheet.

Other changes:

- The currently filtered entries can now be exported from the Journal page.
- The CLI now has a ``--version`` flag.

v1.5 (July 23rd, 2017)
----------------------

Fava now has an interface to edit single entries. Clicking on the entry date in
the Journal will open an overlay that shows the entry context and allows
editing just the lines of that entry.

Other changes:

- The source editor now has a menu that gives access to editor commands like
  "fold all".
- Entries with matching tags or links can now be excluded with ``-#tag``.
- The keyboard shortcuts are now displayed in-place.
- The ``incognito`` option has been removed and replaced with a ``--incognito``
  command line switch.
- As always, several bugs have been fixed.

v1.4 (May 14th, 2017)
---------------------

Fava now provides an interface for Beancount's import system that allows you to
import transactions from your bank for example.

Fava can now show your balances at market value or convert them to a single
currency if your file contains the necessary price information.

We now also provide a compiled GUI version of Fava for Linux and MacOS. This
version might still be a bit buggy so any feedback/help on it is very welcome.

Other changes:

- The ``insert-entry`` option can be used to control where transactions are
  inserted.
- The transaction form now accepts tags and links in the narration field.
- Budgets are now accumulated over all children where appropriate.
- As always, several bugs have been fixed.

Thanks to :user:`TZdyrski` and :user:`Akuukis` for their contributions.

v1.3 (March 15th, 2017)
-----------------------

The translations of Fava are now on `POEditor.com
<https://poeditor.com/projects/view?id=90283>`__, which has helped us get
translations in five more languages: Chinese (simplified), Dutch, French,
Portuguese, and Spanish. A big thank you to the new translators!

The transaction form has been improved, it now supports adding metadata and the
suggestions will be ranked by how often and recently they occur (using
exponential decay).

The Query page supports all commands of the ``bean-query`` shell and shares its
history of recently used queries.

Fava has gained a basic extension mechanism. Extensions allow you to run hooks
at various points, e.g., after adding a transaction. They are specified using
the ``extensions`` option and for an example, see the ``fava.ext.auto_commit``
extension.

Other changes:

- The default sort order in journals has been reversed so that the most recent
  entries come first.
- The new ``incognito`` option can be used to obscure all numbers.
- As always, several bugs have been fixed.

Thanks to :user:`johannesharms` and :user:`xentac` for their contributions.

v1.2 (December 25th, 2016)
--------------------------

You can now add transactions from within Fava. The form supports autocompletion
for most fields.

Fava will now show a little bubble in the sidebar for the number of events in
the next week. This can be configured with the ``upcoming-events`` option.

Other changes:

- The payee filter can filter by regular expression.
- The tag filter can filter for links, too.
- There's a nice spinning indicator during asynchronous page loads.
- The Journal shows little indicators for metadata.
- As always, several bugs have been fixed.

Thanks to :user:`fokusov` for their contributions.

v1.1 (November 19th, 2016)
--------------------------

You can now upload documents by dropping them onto transactions, which will
also add the file path as `statement` metadata to the transaction. Fava also
ships with a plugin to link these transactions with the generated documents.
See the help pages for details.

This is the first release for which we provide compiled binaries (for macOS and
Linux). These do not have any dependencies and can simply be executed from the
terminal.

Other changes:

- The bar charts on account pages now also show budgets.
- The Journal can now be sorted by date, flag and narration.
- Fava now has a Russian translation, thanks to :user:`fokusov`.
- As always, several bugs have been fixed.

Thanks to :user:`adamgibbins` and :user:`xentac` for their contributions.

v1.0 (October 19th, 2016)
-------------------------

This is a major new release that includes too many improvements and changes to
list. Some highlights:

- The layout has been tweaked and we use some nicer fonts.
- Fava looks and works much better on smaller screens.
- Fava loads most pages asynchronously, so navigating Fava is much faster and
  responsive.

Fava's configuration is not read from a configuration file anymore but can
rather be specified using custom entries in the Beancount file. Some options
have also been removed or renamed, so check Fava's help page on the available
options when upgrading from v0.3.0.

There have been many changes under the hood to improve Fava's codebase and a
lot of bugs have been squashed.

:user:`yegle` for their contributions.
